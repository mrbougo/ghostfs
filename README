ghostfs is a fuse driver that fakes the presence of files, directories and
links with (mostly) right stat information. It reports the right size, mode,
uid, gid and access/modification/change times.

Usage:
First create a list file; then, mount it:
	ghostfs-list dir > listfile
	ghostfs mountpoint listfile
Alternative: using gzip compression and pipes:
	ghostfs-list dir | gzip > listfile.gz
	gunzip -c listfile.gz | ghostfs mountpoint -

For more info, read the included perldoc using the commands "perldoc ghostfs"
and "perldoc ghostfs-list".

Note:
find can also be used to generate list files:
	format='%p\0%U:%G\0%A@\0%T@\0%C@\0%s\0%y\0%l\0%#m\0\n'
	( cd dir; find -printf "$format"; ) > list_file
