ghostfs is a fuse driver that fakes the presence of files, directories and links with (mostly) right stat information. It reports the right size, mode, uid, gid and access/modification/change times.

Usage:
First create a list file using "ghostfs-list dir > listfile". Then, mount it using "ghostfs mountpoint listfile".

For more info, read the included perldoc using the commands "perldoc ghostfs" and "perldoc ghostfs-list".

Note:
find can also be used to generate list files:
	format='%p\0%U:%G\0%A@\0%T@\0%C@\0%s\0%y\0%l\0%#m\0\n'
	( cd dir; find -printf "$format"; ) > list_file
